# Secure-Data-Hiding-in-Images-Using-Steganography

This project is a GUI-based Image Steganography tool built using Python and Tkinter, allowing users to hide and retrieve secret messages within images using a passcode


## Features

- Encrypt text messages inside images.
- Passcode-based security with hashing for verification.
- Decrypt hidden messages from images using the correct passcode.
- User-friendly interface with side-by-side encryption & decryption.

## How it works
1. ENCRYPTION
- Select an image.
- Enter a secret message and passcode.
- The tool embeds the message into the image and saves it.


2.DECRYPTION
- Select the encrypted image.
- Enter the correct passcode.
- The tool retrieves and displays the hidden message.
